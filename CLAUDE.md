# agendaê — Project Context for Claude

Multi-tenant SaaS for service booking (barbershops, esthetic studios, manicure salons). Each tenant gets a public URL where customers book without an account.

Built by a junior dev as portfolio + learning piece. Code quality matters more than feature breadth. Explanations should be paced and pedagogical, in Portuguese (pt-BR).

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack, React Compiler) + React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript 5 strict (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`)
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (via Docker Compose)
- **ORM**: Prisma 6.19 with `engine: "classic"` in `prisma.config.ts`
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit + integration), `fileParallelism: false`
- **Styling** (future): Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui
- **Auth** (future): NextAuth v5

## Architecture — Clean Architecture + DDD

Layers, dependencies only point inward:

```
src/
├── domain/                # Pure business logic (no Prisma, no Next, no I/O)
│   ├── entities/          # Aggregate roots and entities
│   ├── value-objects/     # Email, Money, TimeSlot, BusinessHours, etc

└── shared/utils/          # Result, Entity, ValueObject, UniqueId, DomainEvent
```

### Domain rules — NEVER break

- Domain code **MUST NOT** import from `@prisma/client`, `next/*`, or any infrastructure
- Entities receive Value Objects, not primitives (`Email`, not `string`)
- VOs are immutable, validated on construction, compared by value
- Aggregates emit events via `pullDomainEvents()`; use cases collect them
- Money is **always** in cents (`Int`), never `Decimal` or `Float`
- IDs use ULID (`UniqueId.generate()` → 26-char string)
- All times stored in UTC; timezone translation happens at presentation only

### Use case pattern

```ts
class XUseCase {
  constructor(private repos: ...) {}

  async execute(input): Promise<Result<DomainError | ApplicationError, Output>> {
    // 1. parse/resolve IDs
    // 2. fetch supporting entities
    // 3. validate cross-entity rules (BookingPolicy or directly)
    // 4. mutate/create aggregate
    // 5. persist (deterministic order, future: transaction)
    // 6. return Result with entities + collected domain events
  }
}
```

Use cases return `Result<E, T>` — typed errors as values. They never throw business errors.

**4.3 Prisma Repositories (🔄 5 OF 6 DONE)**
- ✅ `PrismaClient` singleton em `src/infrastructure/database/prisma/client.ts`
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` ganhou service `postgres-test` (porta 5433, `tmpfs` para velocidade)

- ✅ `PrismaCustomerRepository` + integration tests (8 tests, incl. cross-tenant isolation, PASSING ✅)
- ✅ `PrismaProfessionalRepository` + integration tests (9 tests; `$transaction` + "replace" link sync, PASSING ✅)
- ⏳ `PrismaBookingRepository` — TODO next (last one)

**4.4 Bcrypt PasswordHasher (⏳ NOT STARTED)**
- Will create `BcryptPasswordHasher` implementing `PasswordHasher` port
- Replaces `FakePasswordHasher` in production composition

**4.5 Row-Level Security / RLS (⏳ NOT STARTED) ⭐**
- Enable RLS on all multi-tenant tables
- Policies: "tenant only sees its own rows"
- Set `app.current_tenant` per Prisma session
- Security test: tenant A cannot see tenant B's data

**4.6 Composition Root (⏳ NOT STARTED)**
- Factory that wires use cases with real (Prisma) repos
- Will be used by Server Actions in Phase 5

**4.7 Email handler (⏳ NOT STARTED)**
- `ConsoleEmailHandler` for MVP (logs to stdout)
- Registered on dispatcher to listen to `booking.created`, etc
- Future: swap for Resend in production

- shadcn/ui init + custom theme
- Tenant resolution middleware (slug in dev, subdomain in prod)
- NextAuth v5 integration
- Server Actions consuming use cases
- Public pages: landing tenant `/t/[slug]`, signup, login, booking flow
- Owner dashboard: KPIs, calendar, CRUD services, CRUD professionals, business hours editor
- Customer app: my bookings, reschedule/cancel
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Loading/error states + a11y

### ⏳ Phase 6 — Polish (NOT STARTED)

## Where We Are RIGHT NOW

**Last commit:** `feat(infra): add Prisma client and TenantRepository with integration tests`

**Next concrete step:** Create the 5 remaining Prisma repositories (User, Service, Customer, Professional, Booking) following the pattern of `PrismaTenantRepository`. Then write integration tests covering each.

**Total tests passing:** ~370+ (unit + integration). Run time: a few seconds.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Dev
pnpm dev                                # Next.js dev server
pnpm test                               # Run all tests (unit + integration)
pnpm test:watch                         # Watch mode
pnpm test:ui                            # Vitest UI

# Run a single test file or test by name
pnpm vitest run tests/path/to/file.test.ts   # one file
pnpm vitest run -t "test name substring"      # filter by name (any file)

# Database (dev — port 5432)
docker compose up -d postgres           # Start dev Postgres
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name xxx      # New migration
pnpm prisma studio                      # GUI for the DB

# Database (test — port 5433)
docker compose up -d postgres-test      # Start test Postgres
pnpm db:test:up                         # Start test DB + apply migrations
pnpm db:migrate:test                    # Apply migrations to test DB only

# Quality
pnpm typecheck                          # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint                               # ESLint
```

## Conventions

- **Code in English**, UI/comments user-facing in Portuguese (pt-BR)
- **Conventional Commits**: `feat(scope): ...`, `fix(scope): ...`, `refactor(scope): ...`
- Scopes: `domain`, `application`, `infra`, `presentation`, `shared`, `tests`
- Commits granular per concept; consolidate only when concepts are tightly coupled
- **Never commit `.env`** — only `.env.example`
- File naming: `kebab-case.ts`
- Class naming: `PascalCase`, suffixed by role (`Entity`, `UseCase`, `Repository`, `Mapper`)

## Pedagogical Style (for chat assistance)

When helping the user:

1. Explain **why** before showing **how**. Concepts before code.
2. Use Portuguese for explanations, English for code/commits.
3. Show trade-offs explicitly — never hide design decisions.
4. The user is a junior dev. Connect new concepts to ones already mastered.
5. Avoid over-engineering. Pragmatism > purity for MVP. Document the simplification.
6. When refusing a shortcut, explain the cost of the shortcut.
7. Lists files to create before code, so the user can plan.
8. Provides commands ready to copy-paste (PowerShell-friendly on Windows).

## Known Decisions (don't second-guess)

- `engine: "classic"` in `prisma.config.ts` — chose stability over Prisma 7 adapter setup
- `fileParallelism: false` in Vitest — DB tests must serialize, can't risk races
- Payment is deferred to v2.0 — schema has `requiresPayment` hook on Service
- Multi-tenancy: shared DB + `tenant_id` on every table + planned RLS as defense in depth
- Solo professional auto-created in RegisterTenant when `isSolo: true`
- BusinessHours stored as JSON column (changes rarely, always read whole)
- Booking state machine: SCHEDULED → CANCELLED/COMPLETED/NO_SHOW (terminal)
- Cancelled bookings DON'T block new bookings in the same slot
- Cross-tenant security checks at use-case layer; RLS to be added at DB level
- Customer email uniqueness enforced at repo, not at entity level
- `Booking.create()` accepts optional `now` for deterministic testing
- All Prisma repos use `upsert` for `save` — covers both insert and update
- Idempotent `delete` (catches `P2025` "not found" silently)
- `PrismaProfessionalRepository.save` syncs the `professional_services` join table with the "replace" strategy (delete-all + re-insert) inside a `$transaction` — chosen over incremental diff because a professional owns few services; can't go inconsistent
